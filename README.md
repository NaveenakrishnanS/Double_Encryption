# Double_Encryption
double layer encryption using python.
I just used Caesar cipher and a symmetric encryption using a public key.

This system has two layers which include:
           1.caesar cipher
           2. Symmetric encryption

#Caesar cipher:

A  Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques.

Named after Julius Caesar, it is one of the oldest types of ciphers and is based on the simplest monoalphabetic cipher. It is considered a weak method of cryptography, as it is easy to decode the message owing to its minimum security techniques.

For the same reason, a Caesar cipher is often incorporated only in parts of other complex encryption schemes.

#Advantages of using a Caesar cipher include:

                                 1.One of the easiest methods to use in cryptography and can provide minimum security to the information
                                 2.Use of only a short key in the entire process
                                 3.One of the best methods to use if the system cannot use any complicated coding techniques
                                 4.Requires few computing resources

#Symmetric Encryption:

Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. The entities communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so that it can be used in the decryption process. This encryption method differs from asymmetric encryption where a pair of keys, one public and one private, is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
