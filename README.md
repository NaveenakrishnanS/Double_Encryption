# Double_Encryption
double layer encryption using python
I just used Caesar cipher and a symmetric encryption using a public key.

This system has two layers:
           1.caesar cipher
           2. Symmetric encryption

#Caesar cipher:

A  Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques.

Named after Julius Caesar, it is one of the oldest types of ciphers and is based on the simplest monoalphabetic cipher. It is considered a weak method of cryptography, as it is easy to decode the message owing to its minimum security techniques.

For the same reason, a Caesar cipher is often incorporated only in parts of other complex encryption schemes.

#Advantages of using a Caesar cipher include:

One of the easiest methods to use in cryptography and can provide minimum security to the information
Use of only a short key in the entire process
One of the best methods to use if the system cannot use any complicated coding techniques
Requires few computing resources
